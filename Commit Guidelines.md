# Commit Guidelines

## Commit Format
```
git commit -m "Type-of-Commit [(Component/Functionality/Feature)-Name]: Commit-Message"
```

## Type of Commit

- Bug Fix (Fixed a Bug)
- Code Refactor (Re-structured the Code)
- Feature (when you've added a new feature)
- Functionality (Updated or Added New Functionality)
- Performance (Improved Performance of Program)

## Component/Feature/Functionality Name
This is the Component, Feature or Functionality you've Added, Changed or Updated.

When making a commit, specify the specific component or feature that your changes are related to. It helps in categorizing and understanding the purpose of the commit. For example, if you're fixing a bug related to user authentication, your Functionality Name might be "User Authentication" or "Login Module."

Ensure that the Name is clear and concise, providing a quick insight into the area of the codebase that your changes are affecting.

## Commit Message
This is a message explaining what changes you've made.

The Commit Message should be a small description of the changes introduced in the commit. It should provide enough information for someone to understand the purpose and impact of the changes without having to look at the actual code diffs.

It helps in maintaining a clear and informative commit history, making it easier for collaborators to understand the evolution of the project. For example, a commit message for a bug fix might look like: "Fix issue with user sessions not persisting after login."
